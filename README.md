<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This repository contains Corinne Fair's work as a Graduate Research Assistant to Dr. Carlos Castellanos at RIT. The purpose of this work is to use computer vision in
  order to detect shapes and movement patterns within bacterial colonies such that these patterns can be replicated virtually or robotically alter their growth; the end goal
  is still being determined. The project primarily uses OpenCV and OpenFrameworks to achieve this, and the repository contains several different projects that each explore 
  different implementations and functions of these libraries in order to create different visual effects. Below is a short overview of each project and its purpose as well as
  a general setup guide.</p>
